		<h3>Granting Issuance: Info</h3>

		<p>An issuer's role in the <tt>zkcreds</tt> system is to check that a user's request to own a credential is valid. In reality, this often requires the issuer to not only check that the proposed attributes have satisfying values, but also check the validity of these attributes against real-world supporting documentation. Supporting documentation can include anything from additional documents (or other <tt>zkcreds</tt> credentials!) attesting to the proposed attributes, a digital copy of the real-world credential's public attributes, or even a zero-knowledge proof that the private values match!</p>
		<p>Allowing issuers to check for the validity of attributes using external supporting documentation in this manner allows <tt>zkcreds</tt> to interoperate seamlessly with existing identity architecture. Furthermore, as long as the issuer posts the proof of valid supporting documentation along with the committed attributes (the request itself, in this demonstration), this allows for any interested person to audit the entries in the list of issued credentials! Consequently, public verification allows one to somewhat relax their trust in issuers to only issue valid credentials into the system. Furthermore, this allows others to issue real-world credentials into the system without ever involving the original issuer at any point in the process!</p>
